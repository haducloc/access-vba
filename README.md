## Access VBA Framework

- Build scalable, reliable database applications using **Access forms** as the front end.
- VBA knowledge is required, but the framework is:
  - Easy to use  
  - Easy to maintain  
  - Easy to scale
- Database storage can be **any SQL database**:
  - SQL Server  
  - MySQL  
  - PostgreSQL  
  - Oracle  
  - etc.
- **Note:** Access is used **only** as the front end.  
  - The database storage **must not** be Access.
  - This ensures scalability, reliability, performance, multi-user concurrency, and cloud readiness.
  - No local Access tables are required.
